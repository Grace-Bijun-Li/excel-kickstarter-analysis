# Excel-Kickstarter-Analysis

## Introduction
This is an Excel analysis of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to determine the trends and correlations underneath the database.

## Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in order to discover some tricks to success. Here is the analysis of a subset (4.000) of the past Kickstarter projects using praphings and pivot tables.
